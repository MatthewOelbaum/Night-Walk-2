My Web PixisJS Game

There have been instances where downloading the game directly leads to issues in loading it. Incase of this you can still play the game with this link: https://people.rit.edu/mro5772/230/project1/PlayGame 

This Javascript/Html5 game was made with PixisJS.

All code and art assets were made by me.

Music was made by Dance of the Dead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Egf1OZ1CuE

Controls: Use the Mouse to make the player avoid the enemies.
